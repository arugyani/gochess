# gochess

This project is my way of learning Go.

# method

I'll be following test-driven development (TDD) throughout this project. The specific approach is called _red_, _green_, _refactor_:

- Red — thinkg about _what_ you want to develop
- Green — think about _how_ to make your tests pass
- Refactor — think about _how_ to improve your existing implementation
